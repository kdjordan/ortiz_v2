			<p>
				Randy Ortiz is a Eugene, Oregon based, Southern California
				native, who received his Fine and Applied Arts degree from the
				University of Oregon in 2003.
			</p>
			<p>
				Trained in the classical drawing and sculptural methods passed
				down over millennia, Randy has amassed extensive knowledge of
				long-established design principals and techniques trusted
				throughout humanitiesâ€™ imaginative evolution. Working apace
				with contemporary building trends in wide ranging mediums has
				allowed Randy to successfully envision a channel between
				modern design esthetics and those of antiquity.
			</p>
			<p>
				His work can be found in both private and public collections
				throughout the Willamette valley and beyond.
