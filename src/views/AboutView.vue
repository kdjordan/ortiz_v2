        Randy Ortiz is a Eugene, Oregon based, Southern California native, who received his Fine and Applied Arts degree from the University of Oregon in 2003.

        Trained in the classical drawing and sculptural methods passed down over millennia, Randy has amassed extensive knowledge of long-established design principals and techniques trusted throughout humanitiesâ€™ imaginative evolution. Working apace with contemporary building trends in wide ranging mediums has allowed Randy to successfully envision a channel between modern design esthetics and those of antiquity.
      </p>
      <p>
        His work can be found in both private and public collections throughout the Willamette valley and beyond.
